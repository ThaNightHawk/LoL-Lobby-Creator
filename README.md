# LoL-Lobby-Creator
Script to make creating custom ARAM games easier.

The script is configured to **my** use-case.
It's blindpick because my friendgroup use a "3 random"-rule, where We press "Random" 3 times, and can pick from those 3 champs.

- Creates an ARAM lobby
- Can search for a list of friends to invite, if they're in a group called "ARAM" in your friends-list.
- Search for individual players (RIOT#ID)
- List people currently added to the invite list
- Automatically create lobby and invite people from "ARAM"-group on friendslist.
